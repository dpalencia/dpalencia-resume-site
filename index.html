            <p>Hello! My name is Daniel and I am a senior Computer Science major at California State University, Northridge.</p>
            <p>I worked as the technical consultant for a small graphic design agency before deciding to commit to studying computer science and furthering my coding skills. My work there involved collaborating with my graphic designer colleagues to build and troubleshoot WordPress and Shopify websites. I participated in the 2020 NSF Data Science summer bootcamp in which I was also introduced to data science and machine learning concepts. I spent time working on a computer vision project involving a NASA dataset of HiRISE images, where I worked with PyTorch to train and evalute convolutional neural networks.</p>
            <p>Currently I am looking for a place to lay my professional roots down and begin my post-college career.</p>
