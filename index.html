                <h3>They/Them/Theirs</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Daniel and I am a Computer Science graduate from California State University, Northridge currently working as a summer intern for NASA Armstrong.</p>
                <p>I worked as the technical consultant for a small graphic design agency before deciding to commit to studying computer science to further my technical skills. My work there involved collaborating with my graphic designer colleagues to build and troubleshoot WordPress and Shopify websites.</p>
                <p>I participated in the 2020 NSF Data Science summer bootcamp in which I was also introduced to data science and machine learning concepts. I spent time working on a computer vision project involving a NASA dataset of HiRISE images, where I worked with PyTorch to implement a convolutional neural network into a pipeline that identifies surface features on Mars.</p>
